# ARES Monitor / APOSI Specification
A basic Monitor for Linux/macOS with VERY specific Types.


## What's APOSI?
"APOSI" (Anti POSIX System Interface) is a System model that goes against EVERYTHING POSIX offers.

Made for the funs and giggles to cause YOU headaches and constant 'No Command Specified.' errors.


## How to build?

### Before Building

*This project requires either macOS or Linux's version of clang++ (LLVM) and MAKE (Both installable either through Xcode or apt/emerge/pacman)*

## Compiling
simply run 
```bash
$ make # defaults to making `all` target.
```
```bash
$ make all # You can also specify the target explicitly.
```
or 
```bash
$ make -j$(nproc) # you can specify the maximum amount of jobs that MAKE can invoke by calling nproc to get the systm's available cores
```
to build the `bin/ARES.MON` target.

## How to clean binaries?

You can clean binaries either by doing:

```bash
make clean
```

or

```bash
rm bin/* # this is ran by ´make clean´ with the help of a helper script.
```

both will delete the binary generated by the [Makefile](Makefile)

## How to use:
ARES Expects either:
```
@[CMD]
\@[BUILTIN]
[varname] [value]
```

so using `ls .` will NOT work, and return an error.
